            <h2>Roast beef is a classic centerpiece on the holiday dinner table, and for very good reason.</h2>
            <p>There's no single cut of beef that is necessary to make roast beef; some common cuts include top-round roast, top sirloin roast, bottom-round roast, and eye of round roast. We usually use a top-round roast, but a bottom-round roast would work too. If you're unsure, ask your butcher! Since the meat is slow-roasted for a long amount of time, tougher, lean cuts of meat are ideal because they will still come out tender. Just be aware that if you choose a particularly lean cut of meat, it should be sliced relatively thin to avoid being too chewy.</p>
            <p>It's all about cooking low and slow. With a cut of meat like this, a longer cook time will give you better, more tender results. Ideally, all roasted meats would be seared on all sides in a hot skillet to develop a golden, delicious crust. With something like a top-round roast, searing can be next to impossible (AKA, it's WAY too big and heavy to move around in a skillet). Starting with a hot oven gives the roast a chance to get that beautiful crust without bringing out a pan. After you've got a head start on that crust, you can lower the temperature to 325째, and the meat will start cooking from the inside out.</p>
