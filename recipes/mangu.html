            <h2>Mangu is a classic Dominican dish made with boiled and mashed green plantains that comes together in just 30 minutes.</h2>
            <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had mofongo before, you might be wondering how mangu is any different?</p>
            <p>And while Puerto Rican recipes definitely know how to celebrate plantains (we use them to make tostones, maduros, and more), this Dominican dish takes them in a very different, very delicious direction.</p>
            <p>Mangu is a less heavy, mashed plantain dish that makes a hearty side dish, breakfast, or snack. As mentioned above, it&rsquo;s typical to enjoy this as a breakfast, paired with a few other classic sides that come together to make a meal traditionally called Los Tres Golpes.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil. Peel and slice the plantains into slices small enough to fit into your pot. Once the water is boiling, toss in the plantains and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Strain the plantains from the water and transfer them to a pilon or bowl with the butter. Mash until they become consistent and creamy, adding water a few tablespoons at a time, until the texture is where you want it. Season with salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Fry the onions in a saucepan, saut√© the pickled onions until they begin to turn translucent.</li>
                <li>Serve the mangu with the fried pickled onions on top. Feel free to serve with a fried egg, fried white cheese, and Dominican sausage.</li>
